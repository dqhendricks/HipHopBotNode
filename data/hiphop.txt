Imma bust it opennnnnnn

"Man fuck these bitch ass niggas, how y'all doin'?

I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance,

I go stupid, I go dumb like the three stooges

I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit, no I'm pollution, no substitution

Got a bitch that play in movies in my Jacuzzi, pussy juicy

I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar

Dress like a skater, got a big house, came with an elevator

You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter

Marley said, ""Shoot 'em"", and I said, ""Okay""

If you wanted bullshit then I'm like ole

I don't care what you say, so don't even speak"

Noong ika'y nilalamig, ako'y iyong init

Kapag takot sa bukas, ako'ng unang sisilip

Ginawa ko na ang lahat

Di pa din sapat kasi ika'y mawawala na

Nawalan ng gana ang tadhana

Nanlalamig 'yong dating nagbabaga

Kung maibabalik lang sana

Titiisin ko na kahit paulit-ulit

Tapos pipilitin ko na di maulit

Ang masulyapan mo yung dulo

Akala ko walang hanggan pero may dulo

Bawat segundo sa aking puso iuukit

Lahat ng alaala aking iguguhit,

Para makalimutan mong may dulo

Ang sabi mo walang hanggan

Pero eto tayo sa dulo"

In the hood then the ladies saying ""50 you hot""

They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac

But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco

"Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance

Everybody loves to root for a nuisance

Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since

MC's get taken to school with this music

'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme

Now I lead a new school full of students

Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-

-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position

To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'

Roll Hall of Fame

Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames

Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame

On the wall of shame

You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames

Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?

Little gay looking boy

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy

You witnessing a massacre

Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy

Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy

You get a thumbs up, pat on the back

And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy

Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?

I got a ""hell yeah"" from Dre looking boy

I'mma work for everything I have

Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy

Basically boy you're never gonna be capable

To keep up with the same pace looking boy"

Sigurado kahit di kabisado

Gagawin ko ang lahat. Walang pake kung di sapat

Kasi ikaw ay mawawala na

Nawalan ng gana ang tadhana

Nanlalamig iyong dating nagbabaga

Kung maibabalik lang sana

Iindahin ko ang sakit na gumuguhit

Ngingiti sa likod ng luhang pumupunit

Baka masulyapan mo yung dulo

Kasi sabi mo walang hanggan, Ba't merong dulo?

Ibibigay ko ang lahat paulit ulit

Bawat pagkakataon ay aking isusulit

Basta matalikuran mo yung dulo

Ang sabi mo walang hanggan

Ba't na'ndito tayo sa dulo?

"Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti

He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready

To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'

What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud

He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out

He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now

The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!

Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity

Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked

He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No

He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes

It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke

He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its

Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody

He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him1"

All of my Dominicano's right there up on Broadway,

Pull me back to that McDonald's, took it to my stashbox, 560 State St.

Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons wippin' pastry's

Cruisin' down 8th St., off white Lexus

Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me

"But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes

I got a laptop in my back pocket

My pen'll go off when I half-cock it

Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Made a living and a killing off it

Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office

With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack

I'm an MC still as honest

But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)

This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop

You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap

Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac

The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing

That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table

Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact

How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack

Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad

It's actually disastrously bad

For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as1"

Fact that I can't get by with my nine to

Five and I can't provide the right type of

Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers

And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer

This is my life and these times are so hard

And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus

See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna

Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much

For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not

Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got

To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot

Sending dollars to my whole family

We have one person above

His name is Donald Trump and he's at the top.

From here we sing to you

Can I get my VISA?

Martinez Twins representing Spain

From poverty to fame"
"Mouth wide open, mouth wide open

Mouth wide open like I was at the dentist

Mouth wide open, mouth wide open

Put it so deep I can't speak a sentence"
"With our hearts we sing

Oh Jesus, oh Jesus

Your presence is heaven to me

Oh Jesus, oh Jesus

Your presence is heaven to me"
"Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings

But I'm only going to get this one chance

Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)

Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what

If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,

And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances

You were just what the doctor ordered"
"Make him bust three nuts, is the task

My panties stuck in my ass

So I pulled them down to show him the pearl

Made his pubic hairs curl fast"
"Who is like You Lord in all the earth?

Matchless love and beauty, endless worth

Nothing in this world can satisfy

'Cause Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry"
"Bitches lookin' at me strange but you know I don't care

Step up in this mothafucker just to swingin' my hair

Bitch quit talkin', Crip walk if you down with the set

Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope from this jet"
"You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub

Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs

I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love

So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed"
"When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

Wild, wild, wild

When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts"
"So this one's dedicated to them girls

That let us flop around on top of them

If you're near or far, whether short or tall

We wanna thank you all for lettin' us fuck you"
"Your presence is heaven to me

Your presence is heaven to me"
"Finna get the dick wet and firm

You better sweat me out of my perm

Can't wait till it's my turn

I wanna blow bubbles with sperm"
"So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda

But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda

You can do side bends or sit-ups

But please don't lose that butt

Some brothers want to play that hard role

And tell you that the butt ain't gol'

So they toss it and leave it

And I pull up quick to retrieve it

So Cosmo says you're fat

Well I ain't down with that

'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'

And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'

To the beanpole dames in the magazines

You ain't it, Miss Thing

Give me a sista, I can't resist her

Red beans and rice didn't miss her

Some knucklehead tried to dis

'Cause his girls are on my list

He had game but he chose to hit 'em

And I pull up quick to get wit 'em

So ladies, if the butt is round,

And you want a triple X throw down,

Dial 1-900-MIXALOT

And kick them nasty thoughts

Baby got back"
"Uh, uh huh

So what I keep 'em rolled up

Saggin' my pants not caring what I show

Keep it real with my niggas

Keep it player for the hoes

And look clean don't it?

Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it

Give me some 501's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers

And smoke them hoes down 'till they stingers

You a class clown and if I skip for the day I'm with you bitch smokin' grade A"
"I like big butts and I can not lie

You other brothers can't deny

That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist

And a round thing in your face

You get sprung, want to pull up tough

'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed

Deep in the jeans she's wearing

I'm hooked and I can't stop staring

Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha

And take your picture

My homeboys tried to warn me

But with that butt you got makes (me so horny)

Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin

You say you want to get in my Benz?

Well, use me, use me

'Cause you ain't that average groupie

I've seen her dancin'

To hell with romancin'

She's sweat, wet,

Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette

I'm tired of magazines

Sayin' flat butts are the thing

Take the average black man and ask him that

She gotta pack much back

So, fellas (yeah) Fellas (yeah)

Has your girlfriend got the butt? (hell yeah)

Tell 'em to shake it (shake it) shake it (shake it)

Shake that healthy butt

Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty)"
"So what we get drunk

That's how it's supposed to be

Living young and wild and free"
"I just had sex

And it felt so good (felt so good)

A woman let me put my penis inside her (her)

I just had sex (Hey!)

And I'll never go back (never go back)

To the not having sex

Ways of the past"
"Let's go!

'Cause I feel like I'm running

And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away

Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop

'Cause you know I gotta win everyday day, day, go!

See they don't really wanna pop me

Just know that you never flop me

And I know that I can be a little cocky

You ain't never gonna stop me

Every time I come a nigga gotta set it,

Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it

Then I gotta blow"
"All my days on earth I will await

The moment that I see You face to face

Nothing in this world can satisfy

'Cause Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry"
"I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

"And I be banging on my chest,

And I bang in the east, and I'm banging in the west

You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press

Do you really wanna know what's next? Let's go

See the way we on and we all up in the race and you know

We gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace

We struggling and hustling and sending it and getting it

And always gotta take it to another place

Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it

And I gotta cut all through his traffic

Just to be at the top of the throne

Better know I gotta have it, have it"
"And you should love it, way more then you hate it

Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it

I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life

You that fagot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?

When my junk get to pumping in the club it's on

I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she gone

If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn

If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned

I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up

If the niggas hate then let 'em hate

Watch the money pile up

Or we go upside there wit a bottle of bub

"Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game

Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can

You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though

But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though

Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock

Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop

Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back

For foreigners it ain't for, they act like they forgot how to act

Eight million stories, out there in it naked

City is a pity, half of y'all won't make it

Me, I got a plug, Special Ed ""I Got It Made""

If Jesus payin' Lebron, I'm payin' Dwayne Wade

Three dice cee-lo, three card monte

"Ohhh Bakit ba biglang meron tayong dulo?

Pangako mo walang hanggan

Pwede bang kalimutan mong may dulo?

Handa 'ko sa walang hanggan

And back then I was rapping for the hell of it

But nowadays we rapping to stay relevant

I'm guessing if can make some wishes out of airplanes

Then maybe oh maybe I'll go back to the days

Before the politics that we call the rap game

And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape

And back before when I tried to cover up my slang

Bitch, I'm sippin tea in yo hood, what the fuck is up?

Bitch, I'm sippin tea in yo hood, what the fuck is up?

Bitch, I'm sippin tea in yo hood, what the fuck is up?"
"Look at me now, look at me now

Oh, I'm getting paper

Look at me now

Oh, look at me now

Yeah, I'm fresher than a motherfucker"
"I don't see how you can hate from outside of the club

You can't even get in

Ha ha ha, Leggo"
"[Verse 2]

Just come put it down my butt

Let's shoot a movie, no cuts

Ride the dick, get my nipples licked

That's breastfeeding while we fuck1"
"Have you ever had sex?

I have, it felt great

It felt so good when I did it with my penis"
"A girl let me do it

It literally just happened

Having sex could make a nice man out' the meanest"
"[Chorus]

Shawty had them Apple Bottom Jeans [Jeans]

Boots with the fur [With the fur]

Got the whole club was lookin at her

She hit the floor [She hit the floor]

Next thing you know

Shawty got low low low low low low low low"
"All I need is my body

My pussy pink just like salami

Don't need no drink to get naughty

Cause bitch I'm not Bill Cosby1"
"How you feel?

Whoopty whoop nigga what?

Dre n' snoop chroniced out

In the 'llac, with doc in the back"
"[Chorus: Jake Paul]

It's everyday bro

It's everyday bro

It's everyday bro

I said it is everyday bro!"
"My flow, my show brought me the dough

That bought me all my fancy things

My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels

Look, nigga, I came up and I ain't changed"
"So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent

Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'

And I should not be woken

I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating

But I got your mom deep throating

I'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle

I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil

It's me, my honesty's brutal

But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

For good at least once in a while

So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle

Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times

But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned

Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime

I know there was a time where once I

Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine

Appeal with the skin color of mine

You get too big and here they come trying to,

Censor you like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from the Marshall Mathers LP

One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine

Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine

See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've

Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal

You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though

And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for

You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows

You're like normal, fuck being normal

And I just bought a new Raygun from the future

To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad

'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad

Singin' to a man while they played piano

Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel

So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day

""Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you""

Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)

Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human

What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman

Innovative and I'm made of rubber

So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you

I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating

How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating

Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting

For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating

Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated

I make elevating music, you make elevator music

Oh, he's too mainstream

Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it

It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it

With rock, shock rap with Doc

Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it

I don't know how to make songs like that

I don't know what words to use

Let me know when it occurs to you

While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you

It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you

How many verses I gotta murder to,

Prove that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!

School flunkie, pill junky

But look at the accolades the skills brung me

Full of myself, but still hungry

I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to

And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues

But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you

I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat

Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky

But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling

Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me

They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate

But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had

Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation

And understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then

But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?

Don't mistake it for Satan

It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas

And take a vacation to trip a broad

And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard

Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?2"
"How'd it get so scandalous?

Oh, how'd it get so scandalous?

Oh, oh, how'd it get, how'd it get

How'd it get so scandalous?

How'd it get so scandalous?

How'd it get so scandalous?

But stay woke

But stay woke"
"I could really use a wish right now

I, I, I could really use a wish right now

Like, like, like shootin' stars

I, I, I could really use a wish right now

A wish a wish right now"
"You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

You own it, you better never let it go

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better"
"Wanna hit it from the back

Let me arch my back

Once I arch my back

That mean attack this pussy2"
"Yeah, yeah I could use a dream or a genie or a wish

To go back to a place much simpler than this

Cause after all the partying and smashing and crashing

And all the glitz and glam and the fashion

And all the pandemonium and all the madness

There comes a time when you fade to the blackness

And when you're staring at the phone in your lap

And you hoping but them people never call you back

But that's just how the story unfolds

You get another hand soon after you fold

And when your plans unravel in the sand

What would you wish for, if you had one chance?

So airplane airplane sorry I'm late

I'm on my way so don't close that gate

If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight and

I'll be right back at it by the end of the night"
"(Little in the middle but she got much back)

(Little in the middle but she got much back)

(Little in the middle but she got much back)

(Little in the middle but she got much back)"
"Gulong gulo ang puso

Saan ba 'to patungo?

Di ko alam

Di ko alam."
"From the ground up

Pound up

It's Taylor Gang

So turn my sound up

And mount up

And do my thang"
